Here I will put the solutions for the first exercise in
Python. Instructions are as follows:

The text files you reorganized in the shell session should be in a single directory and should all have the extension .txt.

   1. Create a function that finds all of the filenames and puts them in a list. ( hint: import os, glob ).
   2. Create a function that, given a line from a file, returns true if that line contains a question with an N response and false otherwise.
   3. Create a function that, given the filename and the line that has a missing response, fixes the missing entry by appending that line with a default answer of gender M.
   4. Use these functions together (probably within the main function) to create a loop that, for each file in the file list, reads each line, determines whether it is missing a response, and if it is, fixes the missing entry in place within the files.

Be sure to commit your changes often and occasionally push your commits to your repository, especially when your solution is complete.

I'll share my solution at the end of the session.
